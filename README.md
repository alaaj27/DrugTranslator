# OmniOncologix
OmniOncologix seeks to utilize co-embedding, a technique that translates heterogeneous data types into a shared numerical space where the gene expression and gene essentiality are better represented. Formally, we denote a cancer cell's gene expression as Gi and its gene essentiality as Ei. Our objective is to map each data type into a shared latent distribution P(Z) using two autoencoders.
